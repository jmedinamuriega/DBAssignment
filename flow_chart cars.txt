New Vehicle Additions: When a new vehicle is added to the Vehicles table, 
it won’t initially be linked to any rental agreement until it’s rented out.
Rental Agreement Updates: If a rental agreement is updated
 (e.g., extended rental period), the corresponding entry in the Rental_Agreements table is updated. 
The one-to-one relationship remains intact.
Vehicle Availability Checks: To check if a vehicle is available, 
you can check if there’s an active agreement for the vehicle in the Rental_Agreements table.
 If there’s no active agreement, the vehicle is available.
